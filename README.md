Redesign of the website for Control System Studio (CSS). Made using GatsbyJS and hosted on netlify.

## Developing/Testing locally
Gatsby has a fantastic development server feature, which allows you to preview the page immediately without building it. Make sure to install all npm dependencies using `npm install` the first time you run the site.
    
    $ npm start
  
## Building
To run the site on a server, it needs to be built first.

    $ npm install
    $ npm run build
  
The website files can be found in `public`.
